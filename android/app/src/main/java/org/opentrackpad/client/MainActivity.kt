     * the app's only way in to anything at all". It reads as a shortcut menu,
     * which is how it was built as one and then quietly showed nothing.
     *
     * ## Why the positions are fixed, when nothing else in the app works this way
     *
     * Everywhere else, a thing the computer cannot serve is **absent** rather
     * than broken — no audio daemon, no audio panel. The ring is the deliberate
     * exception, and the reason is that it is navigation rather than a feature:
     * a rail slot that moves is annoying, a door that moves is disorienting, and
     * this is the one surface the entire app is reached through.
     *
     * That a cable comes out more rarely than a profile is edited makes it worse
     * rather than better. A thing that moves twice a month is a thing nobody
     * builds a habit against, because the habit never survives long enough to
     * form.
     *
     * So an unavailable destination is **dimmed, not gone** — the vocabulary the
     * dead rails already use, and more informative than a gap: "Audio is dim"
     * says there is no computer, an empty quarter of a circle says nothing. The
     * rule is that a panel which cannot work should not be drawn, and a door to
     * it should.
     *
     * Two of these are always live. Profiles and Settings need no computer, so
     * the ring is never a circle of dead ends.
