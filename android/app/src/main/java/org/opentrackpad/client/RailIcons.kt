/**
 * The glyphs the rails draw, as SVG path data on a 20-by-20 grid.

 * Path data rather than one vector drawable per icon, for two reasons. The
 * strings are lifted verbatim from the screens they were drawn in, so a glyph
 * cannot drift from its design by being redrawn by hand; and a rail that will
 * eventually take its shortcuts from the host needs to pick an icon at runtime,
 * which a map does and a folder of resource ids does not.
 *
 * Every path is stroked, never filled, at 1.4 units of that same grid.
