/**
 * The touch surface itself.

 * It reports where fingers are and nothing else. It deliberately does not
 * recognise taps, scrolls or swipes: that is the whole point of the project,
 * and interpreting a gesture here would turn OpenTrackpad into a remote mouse.
 *
 * It also paints itself — the panel, its hairline and the dot grid from the
 * design — and that is all it paints. Nothing here ever calls `invalidate`, so
 * drawing happens when the system asks and never as a consequence of a finger:
 * the touch path and the drawing path do not meet.
