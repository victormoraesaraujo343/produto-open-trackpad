/**
 * The Quick Ring: eight wedges around a hub, over the trackpad.
 *
 * It is the app's only way in to anything that is not the surface itself, which
 * is why the fifth slot of a rail means the same thing everywhere. Everything
 * the interface has no room for is reached through here.
 *
 * It covers the pad and consumes every touch inside it, so while it is open the
 * trackpad sends nothing. That is deliberate rather than incidental: a menu you
 * can accidentally drag the pointer through is a menu that will move the window
 * you are trying to act on.
 *
 * Drawn from `QuickRing.dc.html` at the size it was drawn — the wedges are
 * targets on a surface used without looking, so they are millimetres like the
 * rails. See [Artboard].
