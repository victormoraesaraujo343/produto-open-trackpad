//! The shortcut recorder: one window, one chord, then gone.
//!
//! # Why this is a separate program
//!
//! The daemon injects input and carries one dependency. This draws a window and
//! carries sixty-odd. Keeping them apart is what makes that acceptable — see
//! the note in `Cargo.toml`, which is where somebody counting dependencies will
//! look first.
//!
//! # Why it must always be escapable
//!
//! While it is open it asks the desktop to stop taking keyboard shortcuts for
//! itself, so that a combination like `super+shift+s` reaches this window rather
//! than firing the screenshot tool. That is the only way to record such a
//! chord, and it is also a loaded gun: a window that inhibits shortcuts and then
//! hangs leaves somebody on a desktop where their shortcuts have quietly
//! stopped working, with nothing obvious to blame.
//!
//! So there are three ways out and all of them are automatic:
//!
//! - Escape closes it, from any state;
//! - losing focus closes it, and it never fights to get focus back;
//! - it closes itself after `IDLE_TIMEOUT` with nothing pressed.
//!
//! Nothing about recording a shortcut is slow. A recorder nobody is using has
//! no business existing.
