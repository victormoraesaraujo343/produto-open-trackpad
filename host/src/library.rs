//! The two domains about shortcuts: what is recorded, and what is on offer.
//!
//! # Why they are two domains and not one
//!
//! `shortcuts` is what has been recorded and can be fired — the profile
//! editor's library. `import` is what this computer has that OpenTrackpad does
//! not: offered, reviewed, accepted or not.
//!
//! A candidate is not a shortcut with a flag on it. Folding them together would
//! leave `shortcuts` carrying entries that cannot be fired, which is precisely
//! how a button that does nothing gets built. Keeping them apart means every
//! entry in `shortcuts` is fireable and every entry in `import` is not, and
//! neither list has to be read with a caveat.
//!
//! # Why the offer can be asked for again
//!
//! Someone who binds a new desktop shortcut next month should be able to pick
//! it up. A one-shot offer at first connection makes the only chance to say yes
//! the moment somebody is least ready to decide. So the host offers whatever it
//! finds that is not already recorded, whenever asked; with nothing to offer the
//! domain is simply empty, the way audio is absent with no sound daemon.
//!
//! # Why it is threaded
//!
//! Reading a desktop's configuration means a file on KDE and five `gsettings`
//! calls on GNOME. That is tens of milliseconds, and the thread it must not
//! happen on is the one carrying touch frames.
