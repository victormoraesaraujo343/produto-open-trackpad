//! Symbolic key names, and the chords built from them.
//!
//! The client sends names rather than Linux key codes, so the two sides are not
//! coupled to the kernel's numbering and a malformed action is caught here
//! instead of becoming a wrong keystroke.
//!
//! The set is deliberately closed. Anything outside it is rejected, which is
//! what stops a control surface from turning into a way to press arbitrary keys
//! on someone's desktop.
//!
//! # Why it covers a whole keyboard now
//!
//! It used to hold the handful of keys the built-in profiles reach for. The
//! recorder captures whatever key was actually pressed on the host, so a
//! vocabulary with gaps in it fails at the moment somebody presses one — and it
//! fails by telling them their keyboard is wrong.
//!
//! Widening the names does not widen who may add a shortcut. What the phone is
//! allowed to *fire* is a separate question, kept in `crate::shortcuts`; a name
//! existing here only means the host can say what a key is called.
//!
//! # `print` is `KEY_SYSRQ`, and that is worth knowing
//!
//! Print Screen and SysRq are one key. On a kernel with `kernel.sysrq` enabled,
//! Alt held with it is the magic SysRq sequence — `alt+print+b` reboots the
//! machine without unmounting anything, and a virtual keyboard can produce it
//! as readily as a real one.
//!
//! It is in the list because the person at the machine may reasonably want Print
//! Screen on a rail button, which is the decision recorded in the roadmap. The
//! protection is not this list: it is that a chord has to be recorded by
//! somebody physically pressing it here before the phone can fire it. That
//! protection only holds if `crate::shortcuts` is what decides what may be
//! fired, which is the open question in the notes for the orchestrator.
