//! The windows open on this desktop, most recently used first.
//!
//! Feeds the recent-applications rail: four windows and a fifth slot for the
//! rest, and tapping one switches to it.
//!
//! # Why this is KDE-only, and why through two tools rather than one
//!
//! `docs/ROADMAP.md` deferred this because Linux has no single way to enumerate
//! windows, and named `org_kde_plasma_window_management` as the KDE answer.
//! **That is not available.** KWin advertises sixty-six Wayland interfaces to an
//! ordinary client and window management is not among them — it is kept for
//! privileged clients like the desktop shell itself. Checked with
//! `wayland-info`, not assumed.
//!
//! What does work is KWin's own scripting engine, reached the way everything
//! else here reaches the system: by running a command. A small script is loaded
//! into KWin over D-Bus; it prints a line whenever a window is opened, closed or
//! switched to; and that line is read back out of the journal. Activation goes
//! through KWin's window runner, which is the same interface KRunner uses when
//! somebody searches for a window and presses return.
//!
//! No new dependency, and the same shape as the sound daemon: exec a tool, read
//! its text, and let a separate process do the talking.
//!
//! # Recency was established, not assumed
//!
//! The script reports windows in stacking order, reversed. That is a claim worth
//! testing rather than believing, so it was tested: with Dolphin last in the
//! list, activating it moved it to the front and left everything else in place.
//! Stacking order follows use. `WindowsRunner`'s own ordering was tried first
//! and does **not** — activating a window left its list identical, which is
//! exactly the kind of wrong that looks right for an hour.
//!
//! # The client never sees a KWin identifier
//!
//! KWin names windows with a UUID. Those are replaced with numbers of this
//! host's own, handed out in order and never reused, so a client can only ever
//! name something this host published — the same rule the audio panel and the
//! shortcut list keep. It also means a stale button cannot switch to whatever
//! window inherited an identifier.
//!
//! # A window list is a privacy surface
//!
//! Titles say what somebody is reading, writing and talking to. This is
//! deliberate rather than incidental: the list is assembled on the host, it goes
//! only to a client that asked for the capability at the handshake, and it goes
//! nowhere else. Titles are percent-encoded on the wire like every other free
//! text — a browser tab title is whatever a web page decided to call itself, and
//! is the most attacker-influenced string this product handles.
