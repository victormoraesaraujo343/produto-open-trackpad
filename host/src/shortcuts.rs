//! Custom shortcuts: recorded on this machine, kept on this machine.
//!
//! The closed vocabulary is what stops a control surface from being a remote
//! shell with buttons on it. It stays closed — it just becomes editable by the
//! person sitting at the keyboard. Nothing here is reachable from the phone:
//! the client may *ask* for the recorder to open, which is only another action,
//! but the chord itself is authored by somebody physically pressing keys.
//!
//! # A recorded chord is not a privileged chord
//!
//! It is written down as text, read back, and put through `Chord::parse` — the
//! same function, with the same rules, that a chord arriving on the socket goes
//! through. There is no second path into the keyboard that skips the first
//! path's checks, and a file edited by hand gets no more trust than a client
//! does.
//!
//! # Names are escaped, on disk as well as on the wire
//!
//! A name is free text a person typed, and it reaches the phone. It is written
//! with the same encoding device names use, for the same reason: a name is
//! stored on one line, and a name containing a newline would otherwise be able
//! to write its own lines into this file. Somebody will type a `%` or an
//! accented character on the first day.
//!
//! # The file
//!
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opentrackpad/shortcuts`, one record per line, in the same
//! plain shape as everything else here so it can be read without a tool:
//!
//! ```text
//! version 1
//! next 7
//! shortcut 3 ctrl+shift+t Reopen%20closed%20tab
//! ```
