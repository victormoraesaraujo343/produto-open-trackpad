  --dry-run          do not create a virtual device; print pad events instead
  --self-test        replay synthetic contacts and exit, without listening
  --soak MINUTES     replay them on a loop for that long, then report on
                     stuck contacts and memory growth. Moves the pointer
                     continuously, so run it on an idle machine.
  --shortcuts        list what the phone may fire, and what this computer
                     could add to it, then exit
  --print-events     also print every pad event while a client is connected
  --trace-timing     log how frames are spaced, on the phone and on arrival.
                     Pointer acceleration is computed from velocity, so
                     bunched-up frames make it misbehave.
