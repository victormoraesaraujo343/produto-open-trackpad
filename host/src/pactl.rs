//! Talking to whichever sound daemon is running, through `pactl`.
//!
//! ## Why a command and not a library
//!
//! The panel has to work on PipeWire and on PulseAudio, and `pactl` is the one
//! interface that answers for both: PipeWire ships `pipewire-pulse`, PulseAudio
//! speaks it natively, and one code path therefore covers both without
//! detecting which is running. Linking a client library would mean picking one
//! of them, adding a C dependency and a main loop to a daemon that has exactly
//! one dependency today, and still needing the other path for the other daemon.
//!
//! It costs about seven milliseconds a call, measured on the development
//! machine. Which is why the lists are fetched separately rather than all at
//! once: a finger dragging a fader changes the sinks and nothing else, so it
//! pays for one query instead of five. None of it ever happens on the thread
//! carrying touch — see `crate::panel`.
//!
//! ## Why this cannot become a way to run things
//!
//! Every argument below is either a fixed string in this file or an integer
//! this host published in a snapshot and then parsed back out of a request. No
//! text from the client ever reaches a command line, and there is no shell:
//! `Command` execs `pactl` directly, so quoting and metacharacters have nothing
//! to act on. Device names exist only inside this module.

/// Left alone on purpose. The standard library has no timeout on waiting for a

/// child needs its own watchdog thread or a second process per call, and this
/// is called during a fader drag. What was done instead is to make sure the
/// freeze stays inside the panel: this only ever runs on the panel's worker
/// thread, and `crate::panel` never waits for that thread. Touch, shortcuts,
/// the session ending and the next phone connecting are all unaffected — one
/// parked thread is the whole cost.
