//! The return channel: state carried to the client, and requests carried back.
//!
//! Until now the client spoke and the host only listened. That was deliberate
//! and it still holds for the trackpad and for continuous controls — a volume
//! dial sends "a little more" and the desktop shows its own overlay, so the
//! phone never needs to know the value. A mixer cannot work that way: it has to
//! name the devices, show their levels, and change them.
//!
//! ## Why this is threaded, when nothing else here is
//!
//! Reading the sound daemon costs milliseconds and asking it to change
//! something costs milliseconds more. The socket carries touch frames at over a
//! hundred a second, and a frame arriving late is a pointer that stutters. So
//! nothing in this file runs on the thread that reads the socket: requests are
//! handed over and the answer comes back when it comes back.
//!
//! Three threads per session, and each exists for a reason that is not
//! tidiness:
//!
//! - the **outbox**, because writing to a socket the client has stopped reading
//!   blocks, and that must never be the touch thread;
//! - the **worker**, because every `pactl` call blocks;
//! - the **subscription reader** (in `crate::pactl`), because waiting for the
//!   daemon to say something blocks, possibly for hours.
//!
//! ## What a wedged sound daemon may not do
//!
//! It may freeze the panel. It may not stop the trackpad, and it may not stop
//! the daemon from serving the next client — which is why the worker is never
//! waited for when a session ends. A `pactl` that never returns leaves one
//! thread parked; the session still closes, the contacts are still released,
//! and the next phone still connects.
