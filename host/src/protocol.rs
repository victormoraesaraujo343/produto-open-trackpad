/// The protocol version this host speaks, and the one before it.
///
/// Version 2 added the physical size of the touch surface to the handshake.
/// Version 3 added actions. Version 4 opened a channel in the other direction:
/// the handshake carries what the client wants to be told about, the host
/// answers with what it can serve, and state travels back.
///
/// # Why version 3 is still accepted
///
/// Because a client we shipped speaks it and a person uses it every day. The
/// light client is tagged `v0.1-light`, sends `HELLO OTP/3`, and **cannot fall
/// back** — nothing existed before it to fall back to. A version-4-only host
/// refuses its handshake instantly, so installing one would stop a working
/// trackpad with a phone that has no way to find out why.
///
/// The asymmetry is what hides this: the version 4 client copes, because it was
/// built knowing older hosts exist. The shipped one does not, because when it
/// was built there was nothing older to cope with.
///
/// So one version back is served, and only one. A version 3 session gets a
/// virtual touchpad and key chords — everything that version ever had — and
/// nothing that came after it. It is never sent a `WELCOME`, because nothing
/// has ever answered a version 3 client and it is not listening for one.
