# Testing and validation

## What is proven, and what is not

Emitting touch events is not the same as being a touchpad. This file records
what has actually been observed, so nobody has to guess which claims are backed
by a real machine.

| Claim | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Parser and state machine behave as specified | proven by `cargo test` |
| The daemon creates a `uinput` device | observed |
| udev classifies the device as a touchpad | observed |
| libinput classifies the device as a touchpad | observed |
| Injected contacts move the desktop pointer | observed |
| Two-finger scrolling reaches the desktop | observed |
| Three- and four-finger swipe gestures reach the desktop | observed |
| Pinch zoom is delivered continuously, not in steps | observed |
| Runs as a systemd user service | observed |
| Plugging the phone in and opening the app is enough, with no terminal | observed |
| The tray indicator registers with the desktop and tracks state | observed |
| The screen dims when idle and returns on touch | observed |
| Key chords reach the desktop through a separate virtual keyboard | observed |
| The Android client builds and its unit tests pass | proven by `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` |
| The Android client works against the host on real hardware | observed |
| 30 minutes of use leaves no stuck contact | **not yet verified** |

## Automated tests

```bash
cd host
cargo test
```

These cover the protocol parser, the session rules (handshake order, sequence
monotonicity, touch bounds), the contact/slot state machine, and the encoding of
pad events into Linux input events. They do not touch `/dev/uinput`, so they run
anywhere.

## Self-test against the real device

Replays a scripted sequence of one, two, three and four contacts — including a
recycled pointer ID, both surface corners, and a disconnect with fingers still
down — through the real virtual touchpad:

```bash
cd host
cargo run -- --self-test
```

The pointer will move on its own for a few seconds. Two details in the timing
are deliberate, and both were learned the hard way:

- It pauses two seconds after creating the device. A compositor that has not
  finished its udev hotplug simply discards the events, so without the pause the
  test proves nothing and looks like a failure.
- Every stroke is long and smooth rather than a few frames. libinput builds up a
  short motion history before it emits any pointer motion, and a touch lasting a
  handful of frames reads as a tap rather than a drag. A short sequence produces
  no visible cursor movement even when the device is perfect.

To watch the decisions without creating a device at all:

```bash
cargo run -- --dry-run --self-test
```

## Validating on a new machine

OpenTrackpad targets any Linux running libinput, so "it works here" is not an
answer. This script settles it on whatever machine you run it on:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/validate-touchpad.sh
```

It also sends one press of each mouse button and reports how many presses and
releases arrived. A press that arrives without its release is a FAIL rather than
a note: that leaves a button held down on somebody's desktop, which cannot be
clicked out of.

**This script could not answer between OTP/3 and 2026-08-29.** It still sent an
`OTP/2` handshake, so the daemon refused it — and the failure surfaced as "the
daemon did not report a device node", which reads as broken hardware rather than
a stale script. It also picked the device to watch by taking the first event
node in the log, which became the virtual keyboard once that started being
created at handshake time. Both are fixed and the node is now found by name. The
passing run recorded further down this file is still true of the code it was
taken from; anyone who re-ran it in between got a failure that had nothing to do
with their machine.

It starts the daemon, watches its device with libinput, injects synthetic one-,
two-, three- and four-finger strokes through the protocol socket, and reports
whether each one survived — ending in PASS or FAIL with libinput's own reasoning
when something is dropped. It needs the libinput debug utilities (Arch:
`pacman -S libinput-tools`) and a built daemon (`cd host && cargo build`).

Please add the result to the observed-results section below, along with your
distribution, kernel and desktop. That table is the only evidence the project
has that it is not accidentally KDE-specific.

## Checking stability

The acceptance criterion is that half an hour of use causes no stuck touch,
crash or leak:

```bash
cd host
cargo run -- --soak 30
```

It replays contacts on a loop and reports stuck contacts and resident memory at
the end. The pointer moves the whole time, so run it while you are away from the
machine.

## Doing it by hand

The script automates the checks below; run them individually when you need to
see more than PASS or FAIL.

> [!NOTE]
> `libinput list-devices` needs root to open `/dev/input/*`. Without `sudo` it
> silently reports nothing at all, which looks exactly like a rejected device.
> Count its output before concluding anything: zero devices means it could not
> read them, not that yours is broken.

On a KDE Plasma Wayland session there is a check that needs no root at all,
because KWin publishes every device libinput handed it over D-Bus:

```bash
busctl --user introspect org.kde.KWin /org/kde/KWin/InputDevice/eventN
```

`touchpad` must be `true`. If the object does not exist, libinput never accepted
the device.

Start the daemon and leave it running:

```bash
cd host
cargo run
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
# 1. Does libinput see it, and as what?
libinput list-devices | grep -A12 OpenTrackpad

# 2. What did udev decide?
udevadm info /dev/input/eventN | grep ID_INPUT

# 3. What does libinput make of the events? Run this, then run --self-test.
sudo libinput debug-events --show-keycodes | grep -i opentrackpad
```

`libinput list-devices` must report the device with `Capabilities: pointer
gesture` and a `Tap-to-click` entry. A device that shows up only as a pointer,
or that libinput refuses entirely, means the capability set is wrong — fix that
before working on the Android client.

## Observed results

### 2026-08-29 — CachyOS, kernel 7.2.0-1-cachyos, KDE Plasma on Wayland, libinput 1.31.3

`cargo test`:  39 passed.

The daemon creates `/dev/input/event28`, named `OpenTrackpad Touchpad`.

`/proc/bus/input/devices`:

```text
I: Bus=0006 Vendor=1d6b Product=0f0f Version=0001
N: Name="OpenTrackpad Touchpad"
S: Sysfs=/devices/virtual/input/input29
H: Handlers=event28 mouse2
B: PROP=5
B: EV=b
B: KEY=e520 10000 0 0 0 0
B: ABS=661800001000003
```

`PROP=5` is `INPUT_PROP_POINTER | INPUT_PROP_BUTTONPAD`, as intended.

`udevadm info /dev/input/event28`:

```text
E: ID_INPUT=1
E: ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD=1
E: ID_INPUT_WIDTH_MM=140
E: ID_INPUT_HEIGHT_MM=63
```

udev classifies it as a touchpad, and derives the physical size correctly from
the declared axis resolution.

KWin's view of the device, over D-Bus, with no root needed:

```text
.name                    "OpenTrackpad Touchpad"
.touchpad                true
.pointer                 true
.keyboard                false
.touch                   false
.enabled                 true
.tapToClick              true
.tapFingerCount          3
.scrollTwoFinger         true
.supportsClickMethodClickfinger  true
.supportsDisableWhileTyping      true
```

libinput accepts the device and treats it as a touchpad with tap-to-click,
three-finger tap and two-finger scrolling. This is the milestone gate, and it
passes on this host.

The same device, created by the daemon running under
`packaging/opentrackpad.service` with its full sandbox applied, is accepted
identically: the hardening does not block `/dev/uinput`.

### The palm-detection trap

The first working device produced no pointer motion at all, despite passing
every classification check above. `libinput record` showed all 195 evdev events
arriving intact, and `libinput debug-events --verbose` explained why nothing came
out:

```text
event28 - using pressure-based touch detection (102:123)
event28 - palm: pressure threshold is 130
event28 - palm: touch 0 (TOUCH_BEGIN), palm detected (pressure)
```

With `ABS_MT_PRESSURE` declared over 0..1024, libinput put touch detection at
123 and palm rejection at 130 — a seven-unit window. Contacts reporting 600 were
discarded as a resting palm before they could become motion. Removing the
pressure axes fixed it; see the architecture notes for the full reasoning.

The lesson generalises: a device that udev, libinput and the compositor all
accept can still discard every event. Only `debug-events --verbose` shows the
decision, and it is worth reaching for early rather than last.

### Why frame timing decides whether acceleration works

Pointer acceleration is computed from velocity, which is distance over time. A
host that receives correct positions with useless timing cannot accelerate, and
the result feels linear and jittery while every event in the stream looks fine.

The client first sent the batched historical samples inside each Android
`MotionEvent`, which looks like better fidelity. Those samples describe
different moments but reach the host in the same instant, so libinput saw
several positions with no time between them, could not estimate speed, and fell
back to roughly one-to-one movement.

Sending one sample per event fixed it. `--trace-timing` shows the difference by
comparing how far apart the phone says frames were with how far apart they
actually arrived:

```text
phone  11.15 ms   arrived  11.15 ms   contacts 1
phone  11.15 ms   arrived  11.13 ms   contacts 1
phone  11.15 ms   arrived  11.19 ms   contacts 1
```

Healthy input has the two columns matching. Frames arriving within a
millisecond of each other, while the phone claims several milliseconds passed,
mean acceleration is being starved. Zero-contact frames are exempt: a lift has
no velocity to estimate.

### First run against a real phone

A Nothing Phone (2412x1080, Android 16) over `adb reverse`, on the same host.
One finger moved the pointer, two scrolled, and three and four produced swipe
gestures — all through the ordinary Linux touchpad stack, with no gesture
interpretation on the phone.

Two things came out of that first run:

- The pointer felt slow. The virtual pad had been hardcoded to 140x63 mm while
  the phone measures 155x69 mm, and the remaining difference is the desktop's
  own pointer speed setting. The handshake now carries the phone's real physical
  size, which is the only way this can work across devices.
- Two-finger horizontal scrolling felt backwards. That is the desktop's natural
  scrolling preference, not a bug: KDE defaults it off, macOS defaults it on.

### A device must exist before it can be typed on

Shortcuts silently did nothing at first. The keyboard was created when the first
shortcut arrived, and a desktop discards anything from a device it has not
finished opening — so the keystroke that created the device was always the one
lost. Of three volume keys sent as the device appeared, the first vanished and
the rest landed. The keyboard is now built when the session starts.

The same trap caught the touchpad self-test earlier. It is worth stating plainly:

> A virtual input device is not usable the instant it exists. Anything sent
> before the desktop finishes its udev hotplug is discarded, with no error
> anywhere.

Separately, identical chords sent microseconds apart collapse into one somewhere
downstream. At a fifty-millisecond gap all of them land, and a finger on a button
cannot go faster than that, so this is left alone rather than worked around.

### Gesture output, measured

`sudo ./scripts/validate-touchpad.sh`:

```text
evdev events the kernel saw        1807
pointer motion (one finger)          62
scroll (two fingers)                 39
swipe gestures (three, four)         78
pinch updates (zoom)                 86
contacts discarded as palms           0
PASS: pointer motion works.
```

The pinch test spans 90 frames and libinput produced 86 updates from it, which
is about one per frame. Zoom that feels stepped in an application is therefore
the application converting a continuous gesture into discrete steps, not
anything this project can fix: browsers commonly zoom a page in fixed
increments regardless of how far the fingers travelled.

### When plugging the cable back in does not reconnect

Observed 2026-08-30. The symptom is that closing the app, unplugging, plugging
back in and reopening does not connect, and the bridge has to be restarted by
hand from the tray. It reads as the phone app being broken, which is the wrong
place to look: the app is connecting to a `localhost` port on the phone that no
longer leads anywhere.

The watcher is usually not the problem either. `--watch` blocks on the cable
rather than polling it, and a healthy journal shows that plainly:

```text
phone disconnected; waiting for it to come back
USB forwarding active: phone localhost:4242 -> this computer's localhost:4242
```

What went wrong on the development machine was one step further in. `adb` is a
long-lived server that can outlive the truth: it kept listing the phone as ready
while refusing every `reverse` against it, with a running emulator alongside it.
Two episodes were recorded, and they ended differently:

| Window | Repeats | How it ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00:33 – 01:21 | 1357 | a person restarted the service |
| 01:21 – 01:36 | 450 | resolved on its own after 15 minutes |

Neither was recovered by the watcher, which retried every two seconds throughout
and had no other move. That is the defect: **faithfulness was the bug** — it was
retrying something that, for as long as it lasted, could not succeed. That one
episode cleared by itself is the part that makes this hard to catch, because it
means the failure is intermittent rather than permanent and survives a report of
"it works now".

The signature to look for is a line repeating at the retry interval and never
changing:

```bash
journalctl --user -u opentrackpad-usb.service --since -24h |
  awk '{$1=$2=$3=""; print}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

Hundreds or thousands against one message is the failure. A log that repeats
forever is a log nobody reads, which is how both episodes passed unnoticed with
the evidence sitting in plain sight.

The bridge now disbelieves `adb` rather than waiting to be rescued: after five
consecutive failures it reconnects the transport, and restarts the `adb` server
if that does not take — the same thing the person did by hand at 01:21.
Repeated failures are reported once rather than each time, so the journal shows
changes of state instead of the persistence of one.

Two things worth knowing when reading this code:

- **The phone is pinned by serial, not by `adb -d`.** `-d` is resolved fresh on
  every call, so what it means changes when a second device appears; a serial
  does not. This is not hypothetical — a running emulator alongside the phone is
  what both episodes have in common.
- **Emulators are excluded by having no `usb:` field** in `adb devices -l`,
  rather than by matching their name. A device cannot escape the rule by being
  called something else.

To check the bridge by hand, at any time:

```bash
opentrackpad-connect-usb --status    # says whether it is up, and for which phone
opentrackpad-connect-usb             # sets it up; safe to run when already up
```

Both are idempotent. A bridge that is already up is success rather than a
special case, so running either again — from a script, from the tray, from
somebody who is not sure — cannot make things worse.

**What is not covered.** The recovery path has been exercised against a stub
`adb` that fails on demand, not against a real wedged server: the two recorded
episodes both ended before the new code existed. So the logic is proven to do
what it says, not to cure the condition it was written for. That will be known
the next time it happens. Two real phones attached at once is refused rather
than guessed, with `ANDROID_SERIAL` as the way to say which one, and that path
is also stub-tested only.

### When the recorder does not appear

The daemon spawns the recorder as a child, so it inherits the daemon own
environment. If that environment has a poisoned library path — an AppImage or a
bundled runtime supplying an older glib is the usual cause — the recorder dies
at the dynamic-linking stage with an undefined symbol, before it ever draws
anything.

**The daemon cannot tell.** It logs that it opened the recorder either way,
because the spawn succeeded and the death came afterwards. Nothing is wrong with
the daemon, the recorder, or the machine.

One line separates them:

```bash
OPENTRACKPAD_TRACE=1 opentrackpad-recorder
```

`recorder: starting` is printed before any window or display is involved. If it
appears, the program ran and the problem is later. If it does not, it never got
that far, and the environment is where to look.

The systemd user manager on the development machine carries neither
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` nor `GTK_PATH`, so a recorder spawned by the service is safe.
A daemon started by hand from a polluted shell is not.

### Testing the GNOME import without GNOME

Import reads the desktop's own shortcut store, so testing the GNOME path
appears to need a GNOME machine. It does not, and installing one is the wrong
trade: the three packages are 35 MiB, but their dependency closure is 41
packages and 85 MiB — half a desktop environment, as root, on a working machine,
for a test.

Schemas are XML compiled into a blob, and glib will read a blob from wherever
`GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` points. So:

```bash
# no root, nothing installed, one throwaway directory
pacman -Sddp gnome-shell gnome-settings-daemon mutter    # print the URLs
# fetch them, then extract only the schemas:
tar --force-local -xf <package> -C <dir> --wildcards 'usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/*.xml'
glib-compile-schemas <dir>
GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=<dir> opentrackpadd --shortcuts
```

`--force-local` is not optional: the gnome-shell filename contains an epoch
(`1:50.4`), `tar` reads the colon as a remote host, and it silently extracts
nothing.

**What this proves**: reading, parsing, classification, naming and the
recommended set, against real schema shapes. On the development machine it
yielded 99 candidates across all ten groups, including `screenshot` and
`other` — two paths no KDE machine had ever exercised.

**What it does not prove**: the values are defaults rather than somebody's own
bindings, and `gsettings` inside a live GNOME session is not the same thing as
`gsettings` beside one. A real GNOME machine running `opentrackpadd --shortcuts`
is still worth one favour from somebody.

It found a defect nothing else would have. GNOME keeps two keys per media
action: `play`, which a person may change and is usually empty, and
`play-static`, the fixed hardware key where the working binding actually lives.
The suffix was being read as part of the name, so the half that works arrived as
"Play static" and "Mic mute static" — and matched neither the curated name table
nor the recommended list, both of which key on the action. The working half was
unnamed and unoffered while the empty half took the good name.

### With mouse buttons, on OTP/4

`sudo OPENTRACKPAD_PORT=4344 ./scripts/validate-touchpad.sh`, run by the owner
on 2026-08-30. Kernel 7.2.2-1-cachyos, libinput 1.31.3, KDE on Wayland.

```text
evdev events the kernel saw        1807
pointer motion (one finger)          60
scroll (two fingers)                 39
swipe gestures (three, four)         78
pinch updates (zoom)                 86
contacts discarded as palms           0
button presses (left, right, middle)  3 of 3
button releases                       3 of 3
PASS: pointer motion works.
```

**Three of three settles an open question.** A button is pressed and released as
two reports with nothing between them, and this project had already measured
identical chords microseconds apart collapsing downstream — so a zero-duration
click might have arrived without its release, leaving a mouse button held on
somebody's desktop with nothing clickable to escape it. It survives. No
deliberate hold is needed, and the expectation is now a measurement.

The run also re-answers the touch path, which had been unable to answer at all
between OTP/3 and 2026-08-29 for the reasons above.

**The port matters.** The script defaults to 4343, which is also where a
development stand-in host commonly runs; `Address already in use` is that
collision rather than a fault. `OPENTRACKPAD_PORT` moves it.

### Synthetic validation

`sudo ./scripts/validate-touchpad.sh`, after removing the pressure axes:

```text
evdev events the kernel saw        1233
pointer motion (one finger)          62
scroll (two fingers)                 39
swipe gestures (three, four)         78
contacts discarded as palms           0
PASS: pointer motion works.
```

One finger moves the pointer, two scroll, and three or four produce swipe
gestures — through the ordinary Linux touchpad stack, with no gesture
interpretation on the sending side. That is the milestone gate, and it passes.

**Still open on this host:** whether the device survives 30 minutes of real use.
And only a second distribution and desktop can show that nothing here is
KDE-specific.
