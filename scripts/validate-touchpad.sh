# Starts the daemon, watches its devices with libinput, feeds it synthetic one-,
# two-, three- and four-finger strokes over the protocol socket, then a click on
# each mouse button, and reports what libinput made of each one.
#
# The clicks are checked separately because they are a separate device: the
# buttons cannot live on the touchpad, which libinput re-resolves from finger
# count, so they have one of their own. A click is also a press and a release
# with nothing between them, and this project has measured events sent that
# close together collapsing into one, so it is worth proving rather than
# assuming.
#
# Root is required because libinput must open /dev/input/*. Without it,
# `libinput list-devices` reports nothing at all, which looks exactly like a
# rejected device.
#
# Why this exists: a virtual device can satisfy udev, libinput and the
# compositor and still have every event discarded — see docs/TESTING.md. Only
# `libinput debug-events --verbose` shows that decision, so this script asks it
# directly instead of relying on whether someone saw the cursor twitch.
